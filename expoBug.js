While developing a React Native application using Expo CLI, I encountered an issue where the development server would randomly disconnect and fail to restart. This often happened during long development sessions or after making significant code changes. The error messages in the terminal were vague, offering no specific clues about the cause.  I checked network settings and found no problems.  The app itself would continue to run on the device, but I lost the ability to hot-reload changes or debug using the Expo Go app.  This significantly disrupted my workflow.
