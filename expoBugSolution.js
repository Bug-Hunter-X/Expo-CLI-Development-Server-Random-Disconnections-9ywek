The solution to this problem involved a multi-pronged approach:

1. **Check for Port Conflicts:** The most likely cause is that another application was using the same port as the Expo development server.  The default port is 19000.  You can use the `lsof -i :19000` command (on macOS/Linux) or `netstat -ano | findstr :19000` (on Windows) to identify any processes using this port.  If a process is found, either stop it or change the Expo development server port using the `--port` flag (e.g., `expo start --port 19001`).

2. **Check Network Connectivity:** Ensure your device and computer have stable network connectivity. A temporary network issue could lead to these disconnections.

3. **Expo CLI Version:** Update to the latest Expo CLI version. Run `expo update` and make sure all packages are up to date using `npm update` or `yarn upgrade`

4. **Restart Your Computer and Development Server:** Sometimes, a simple restart resolves transient software glitches.

5. **Check Device Connection:** Ensure your device (either physical or emulator) is correctly connected and recognized by your computer.

6. **Clean and Rebuild:**  Clean your project by deleting the `node_modules` folder and reinstalling dependencies (`npm install` or `yarn install`).  Then rebuild the project.

By systematically addressing these factors, I was able to resolve the intermittent development server disconnections.  If these steps do not solve the problem, provide more details about your environment for more specific debugging.
